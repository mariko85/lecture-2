            <h1>Favorite Fried Eggs</h1>

            
            <p>>he crispy olive oil fried egg. These fried eggs have golden, lacy, crispy edges, which contrast beautifully with their runny yellow yolks. Contrast is everything!

Start with a good egg, a hot skillet, and a generous drizzle of olive oil, and you’ll end
 up with the most flavorful fried egg you’ve ever tasted. They are infinitely better than t
 he rubbery, sulfurous eggs that come out of non-stick skillets. In fact, these are the only fried 
 eggs I ever want to eat. </p>
